                    <li>Online directory distributors may link to our Website in the same manner as they hyperlink to
                        the Websites of other listed businesses; and</li>
                    <li>System wide Accredited Businesses except soliciting non-profit organizations, charity shopping
                        malls, and charity fundraising groups which may not hyperlink to our Web site.</li>

                <p>These organizations may link to our home page, to publications or to other Website information so
                    long as the link: (a) is not in any way deceptive; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship,
                    endorsement or approval of the linking party and its products and/or services; and (c) fits within
                    the context of the linking partyâ€™s site.</p>

                <p>We may consider and approve other link requests from the following types of organizations:</p>
